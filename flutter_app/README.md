# GiantPig Flutter App

This directory contains an early Flutter rewrite of the GiantPig app. The Flutter
version displays the same single pig emoji but can run on multiple platforms such
as Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux. HarmonyOS support can be explored via
Flutter's cross-platform capabilities.

To run the app you need Flutter installed. Then run:

```bash
flutter run
```

This is only a starting point and contributions are welcome.
